#' Prepare ICE Matrix and Split Features for Tree Construction
#'
#' Extracts and centers ICE curves from an \code{iml::FeatureEffect} object, and assembles the feature matrix
#' excluding the feature of interest. Intended for use in building interpretable trees from ICE behavior.
#'
#' @param effect An object of class \code{FeatureEffect} (from the \pkg{iml} package) generated with method = "ice".
#'               It must contain long-format ICE results for a single feature.
#' @param testdata A \code{data.frame} or \code{data.table} used to compute ICE, containing all candidate features.
#'
#' @return A list with two elements:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{X}}{A \code{data.table} of splitting features (excluding the feature of interest).}
#'   \item{\code{Y}}{A centered matrix of ICE values, with each row corresponding to an individual sample.}
#' }
#'
#' @details
#' This function transforms ICE data into a wide-format matrix where each row is an ICE curve,
#' and removes any effects of the global PDP by centering each curve around zero.
#' The splitting features matrix \code{X} excludes the feature used for ICE generation.
#'
#' @seealso \code{\link{compute_tree}}, \code{\link{FeatureEffect}}
